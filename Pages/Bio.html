                <p class="pageText" id="bioDescriptor">Born in Florida, Monir Madkour is an Egyptian-Palestinian political artist who was raised in the
                    Middle East. His diverse upbringing has afforded him a global perspective, which he draws from
                    deeply for his work. Initially geared towards medicine, Madkour returned to the United States
                    for college and attended the University of Miami earning his bachelor’s in Biology with minors
                    in Chemistry, Philosophy, and Art. Pivoting to focus on a career as a glass maker he spent the
                    next few years working for multiple institutions in the South Florida glass scene, and during that
                    time he began making politically motivated work. Wanting to delve deeper into the narrative
                    and scope of his own work Madkour chose to pursue a master’s degree and currently attends
                    Alfred University as a graduate student in Sculpture and Dimensional Studies. At Alfred he has
                    expanded his repertoire and investigates video, performance, as well as installation art.</p>
