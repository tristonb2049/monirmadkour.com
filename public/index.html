                         <p class="pageText">Growing up in a region destabilized by war, I have a deep interest in global politics; namely, the repercussions of corruption and oppression. Knowing the role art can play in the promotion of meaningful social change, I cannot help but be drawn to the idea of being part of that movement. In making political art, I aim to confront choices made in politics that lead to the oppression of the innocent. The challenge in that, however, becomes doing so in a way that is conducive to the change I seek without stooping to the levels of propaganda.</p>
                         <p class="pageText">To avoid falling down that hole, I approach the subject matter of my work as objectively as I can, and I try to empathize with the oppressed rather than search for an oppressor to blame. In seeding my work with empathy of my own, I believe I build a good foundation for my attempt to evoke empathy in the viewer. From that seed I begin to approach material choices with a series of questions: From questions like “What medium would best represent/support this narrative?” to “How important is seeing the hand of a maker to this piece? Does it make the subtext richer or does it distract?” I try to coalesce the nebulous cloud of a budding idea to points that I can build from. This is a novel method of approaching art for me, as I used to think of my works in finished, polished ideas without much adaptation or evolution, but this newer method has more depth and more sincere end results that make the challenge worthwhile. </p>

I initially set out to draw attention to the plight of Syrian refugees as a result of their current civil war, but during the making process I expanded the scope of the piece to refugees in general for their plight is one and the same. I thought about what medium would best represent a refugee, a person who has lost a big part of their identity, and I settled on paper - the quintessential material of documents. I made a thousand passport cutouts where all the information and photos were removed, and where smoke char-marks along the lines showed the violence of their excision, and installed them in tight, brick-like rows and columns. </p>
